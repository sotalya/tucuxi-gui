 * @brief The RequestsClient class

 * about pending requests. It shall be subclassed.
 * A DemoClient could generated fake patients, while a REST client could
 * connect to a REST server (Mirth, for instance).
 * Asking for a list or for a request is done via a call to a method,
 * and signals are used to send back the data. This way, the methods are
 * non-blocking and fit well with a client-server implementation.
