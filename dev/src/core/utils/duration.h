/** Simple class that handle duration.
 * \ingroup utils
 * This class is able to load a duration from a string, give some data about it and then re-convert it to a string.
 * Created because QTime is not able to handle more than 24h, and QDateTime is not fitted for this purpose.
 * Duration use the milliseconds as its base of time, and cannot go under 0;

 * \section format From and to string formatting
 * Duration is able to read a time from a string.
 * A simple number is considered as an hour, as is a number followed by an 'h' character.
 * A number after a 'h' character is considered as a number of minutes.
