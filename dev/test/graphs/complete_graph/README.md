Test Graphing.js
================

The test_graphine.html files can be open and should display various graphs based on the tests described in test_graphing.js.

Simply open the file in the browser, and that's it.


All required files are within the current folder except graphing.js, which points to the one used by Tucuxi-gui. It ensures these tests really use the correct one.
