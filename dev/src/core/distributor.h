//! Tucuxi's release distribution system backend.
/** \ingroup core

   This object is able to fetch the last version of the Tucuxi's installer, and then run it.
   It provides :
   \li a way to fetch and check if the current version is the last
   \li a way to download the installator
   \li a way to run the installator

   When an operation failed (returned false), the errors() function can be fetched to find out the reason.

   The channel system enable a software to be connected to a specific channel, and the development team to provide multiple channels.
   For example, a channel can be used for the alpha release, another for the stable one, and another for the development one.
