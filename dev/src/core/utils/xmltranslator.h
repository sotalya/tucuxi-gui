/** \ingroup xmleditor
 *  \brief Find the translation of an XML element.
 *
 * The XML files used by Tucuxi can sometimes provide an element's text in different languages.
 * The structure of those elements is always the same and is as follows:
 * \code
     <tags>
       <tag lang='en'>Text</tag>
       <tag lang='fr'>Texte</tag>
       <tag lang='it'>Testo</tag>
       ...
     </tags>
 * \endcode
 * In order to retrieve the translation corresponding to the language used by the application
 * (or the one passed to the translate functions), the translator will iterate through the children
 * of the current element (<tags> in the example above) and will stop as soon as the text matching
 * the correct language is found.
 *
 * If the text cannot be found, the translator will return the text in english. If it also cannot
 * be fount, then the translator will return the text of the first children it founds. If the element
 * to translate has no children, the translator will return an empty string.
 *
 * The translator can translate the text of a DOM element as well as a XML stream reader element.
